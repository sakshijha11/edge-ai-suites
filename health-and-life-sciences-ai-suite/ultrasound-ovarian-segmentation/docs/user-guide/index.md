# Ultrasound Ovarian Segmentation Sample App

> [!NOTE]

The app demonstrates how Intel hardware acceleration (Intel iGPU, with CPU
fallback) can be applied through OpenVINO to AI-based real-time ovarian tumor
segmentation in 2D ultrasound. It offers two interchangeable models (selected
with `-Arch`): a default promptless SegFormer-B5 (DS2Net) and an optional
prompted SAM-256 pipeline (YOLO bbox → SAM encoder → mask decoder). A decoupled
capture / inference / display architecture keeps the displayed video smooth
regardless of inference speed, and a built-in GPU governor enforces an Intel iGPU
< 80% utilization KPI.

Supported inputs:

- Video file (for demos and benchmarking)
- USB / webcam
- Folder of ultrasound stills (paced like a slideshow)

How to start:

- See [Model Preparation](./get-started/model-preparation.md) to produce the
  OpenVINO IR the app loads — the app does not ship a trained model.
- See [Get Started](./get-started.md) for a step-by-step setup and run guide.
- See [Runtime Configuration](./runtime-configuration.md) for every flag and
  environment variable the app exposes.
- See [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md) for common issues.
- See [Release Notes](./release-notes.md) for version history.
